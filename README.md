Show the Local Weather

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

[ ] I can see the weather in my current location.

[ ] I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

[ ] I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

--Open Weather API--
To pull local weather data

--Ink Scape--
