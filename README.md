Show the Local Weather

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

[X] I can see the weather in my current location.

[X] I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

[X] I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
